Inspired by <a href=\"https://www.instacart.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Instacart</a>.</p>\n<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>I built this website for myself to help assist and track grocery shopping lists. It all started from using a spreadsheet with products prices to budget. I needed some way to avoid manually entering product records and customize images, prices, and preferences.</p>\n<p>Early on, this was a full-stack project with a <a href=\"https://www.mongodb.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Mongo</a> and <a href=\"https://expressjs.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Express</a> server. This was an iteration to the original spreadsheet, providing a simpler interface for managing a grocery list than Google Sheets. The MERN app had basic CRUD operations, but only stored data in the cloud for one user.</p>\n<p>While working through a React course on <a href=\"https://scrimba.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Scrimba</a>, I applied my new-found knowledge to upgrade QuickCart. I migrated to <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Firebase Firestore</a> and implemented proper authentication for individual users.</p>\n<p>From there, I continued expanded the database with product data, cart history, and individual user account details. I added many features to the client to save time when grocery shopping, including a bar-code scan to onboard products and a search bar.</p>\n<p>I started working with the <a href=\"https://wiki.openfoodfacts.org/API\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">OpenFoodFacts API</a> and the <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/food-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Spoonacular API</a> to save even MORE grocery products. These also provided nutrition data to be displayed for each product.</p>\n<p>One issue I ran into was trying to automatically save estimate prices. No services actually track this varying data, it was overkill to start scraping sites for this.</p>\n<p>I learned many development skills during this project, and also had many failures. I learned React, React Router, React Context, MongoDB, Express, Firebase Authentication, Firebase Firestore, MaterialUI, Jest and React Testing Library, using a linter, git workflow, and deploying to Heroku.</p>\n<h2>üåü Features:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Browse grocery products records served from the Firestore database</li>\n<li>Save products to your cart, always persisted in the cloud.</li>\n<li>Analyze the cart to identify empty categories</li>\n<li>Customized product records and create a personal list</li>\n<li>Create an account to access your list anywhere</li>\n<li>Scan a bar code to upload a product pulled from Spoonacular or OpenFoodFacts</li>\n<li>View a history of transaction receipts previous from shopping lists</li>\n<li>Save product images with a convient image searching pop-up connected to Google CSE</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Project Takeaways:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Designed a Firebase Cloud Firestore NoSQL database managing user records, grocery product catalogs, and cart purchase histories</li>\n<li>Organized state management for products, account information, and carts with Context hooks also persisted in the database.</li>\n<li>Integrated Firebase Authentication to assist storing user unique shopping lists, along with customized product records.</li>\n<li>Created a clean and modern user experience with Material UI following a wireframe and site-wide color theme.</li>\n<li>Implemented barcode scanning and external records from the OpenFoodFacts API to onboard new products</li>\n<li>Deployed static client (React) build files to Heroku.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Wireframes:</h2>\n<p>I planned out the UI in Figma for this project, checkout <a href=\"https://github.com/spencerlepine/quickcart/tree/master/whitepaper\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">the wireframes here</a>.</p>\n<h2>üì¶ More Technologies:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://jestjs.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Jest</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://testing-library.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">React Testing Libary</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://world.openfoodfacts.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">OpenFoodFacts</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://cse.google.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Google CSE</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Spoonacular</a></li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>üè† <a href=\"https://www.spencerlepine.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">spencerlepine.com</a> ¬†¬∑¬† üò∫ GitHub <a href=\"https://github.com/spencerlepine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">@spencerlepine</a> ¬†¬∑¬† üê¶ Twitter <a href=\"http://twitter.com/spencerlepine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">@spencerlepine</a></p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"date":"2021-08-28","title":"Portfolio Site","tech":["React","GatsbyJS","GraphQL","Tailwindcss"],"github":"https://github.com/spencerlepine/portfolio-site","external":"https://spencerlepine.com","company":"","slug":"/projects/portfolio-site"},"html":""}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"date":"2021-08-16","title":"README Crawler","tech":["Node.js","jsdom","node-fetch"],"github":"https://github.com/spencerlepine/readme-crawler","external":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/readme-crawler","company":"","slug":"/projects/readme-crawler"},"html":""}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"date":"2021-07-22","title":"ManyShiba Bot","tech":["Shibe.online API","Node.js","Twitter API"],"github":"https://github.com/spencerlepine/manyshiba-bot","external":"https://twitter.com/manyshiba","company":"","slug":"/projects/manyshiba-bot"},"html":""}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"date":"2021-04-04","title":"Spotify Top Songs","tech":["React","Spotify Web API"],"github":"https://github.com/spencerlepine/spotify-top-songs","external":"https://master.dj6fzfb5de88f.amplifyapp.com/","company":"","slug":"/projects/spotify-top-songs"},"html":""}}]}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["1994492073","325176663","604461682","921617919"]}
