      About Me
    </h2>

    <p>
      I'm a front-end software engineer and reservist in the U.S. Army. My mission is to build the future today and be surrounded by innovation. By working on both frontend and backend systems, I have experience with popular tools like React, TypeScript, Node.js, SQL, and MongoDB. Also, using Docker, GitHub Actions, AWS EC2, and Heroku, I love finding ways to automate my development, to test, build, and deploy.
