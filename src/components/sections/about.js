      About Me
    </h2>

    <p>
      I am currently serving in the US Army Reserve while pursuing my dream career in tech. My mission is to build the future today and be surrounded by innovation.
    </p>

    <p>
      By working on both frontend and backend systems, I have experience with popular tools like React, NodeJS, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. Using Docker, GitHub Actions, AWS EC2, and Heroku, I love finding ways to automate my development, to test, build, and deploy.
