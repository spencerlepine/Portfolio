Array destructuring is an easy way to access elements in an Array. Instead of typing out an integer for the exact index, you can quickly assign variable names to different positions.

## How does it work?
Using an existing array, we can assign values to variables in the corresponding array position matching left to right.

```js
let example = [3, 5, 7, 19, 20];
[a, b, c] = example // -> a = 3, b = 5, c = 7
```

No need to define ALL 5 variables. With the remaining elements in the array, it can be accessed quickly with the spread operator (…).

```js
[a, b, c, ...leftover] = [3, 5, 7, 19, 20] // -> leftover  = [19, 20]
```

## Default values:
Note the ability to assign default values with destructuring. If the array doesn’t return a value for that position, it will use the default.

```js
let example = [1]
[firstElem=2, secondElem=9] = example // -> firstElem = 1, secondElem = 9
```

## Variable swap:
One last trick to mention is swapping variables. With a destructuring statement, Javascript allows you to create an array and assign the variables to mismatched positions. No more need to create a third temporary variable.

```js
let right = 9
let left = 7
[left, right] = [right, left]
// right = 7
// left = 9
```

## Conclusion:
Array destructuring can be very useful for quickly accessing certain elements without the need to remember/store the exact index. Once you understand the basics discussed here, it is crucial to learn “Object Destructuring”.
