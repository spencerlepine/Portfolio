## Overview
This was a group project with a group of 4 engineers, each working on one the of the four modules over a span two weeks. Given a wireframe, the goal was to implement all user stories specified in the business requirements document (not sharing, IP of Hack Reactor).

## Description
This frontend project is built to serve product records from an exisiting API.

This project was broken down into four modules: Products Overview, Related/Outfit, Question/Answers, and Rating/Reviews. This frontend client is accessible and optimized for browsing product data.

The group also built a minimal Node.js / Express app to serve static files, as well as forwarding requests to an external (pre-built) products API.

## Project Takeaways:

- Architectured the React frontend service of photo carousel and pop-up modal serving data from external RESTful API backend
- Encapsulated business required click tracking logic in React higher order components to allow consistent tracking of user interactions across the entire application
- Practiced test-driven development for component functionality and page renders with Jest and Testing Library, along with CircleCI
- Improved page load time using dynamic and static compression along with resized images

## Wireframes:

Everything was designed to match this [wireframe](https://xd.adobe.com/view/e600dc0f-454c-44e3-5075-7872d04189ff-9031/), which was provided and not created by the team.

## Engineering Journal:

To keep track of everything I learned, along with the challenges faced during this project, I maintained an Engineering Journal available on [GitHub](https://github.com/fec-bareminimum/project-catwalk/blob/main/resources/journals/SPENCER_JOURNAL.md) or [Gist](https://gist.github.com/spencerlepine/964affee95497d2009f96c0f778a3a41)
