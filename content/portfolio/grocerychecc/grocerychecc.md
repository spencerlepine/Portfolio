## Overview
The goal of this solo project was building a full-stack application in two days. The biggest challenge of this was managing time and balancing trade-offs between functionality and presentability.

## Description

GroceryChecc simplifies brainstorming a shopping list by helping find relevant grocery products and replacement items for you. Helping busy parents save time by generating a complete grocery shopping list from the couch.

The straight-forward interface provides a clean user experience to emphasize critical features. This app helps prioritize essential food products to give a solid foundation of a shopping list.

Automating this process saves time and money. With a dynamic list stored for each user, it is easy to review a birds-eye list of all groceries at once.

## Project Takeaways:

- Connected MongoDB storing grocery lists private to each user
- Implemented Firebase Authentication tracking user accounts to store saved lists
- Built the backend API to fetch and serialize data from the Sequelize API and the OpenFoodFacts API
- Used a straight-forward client interface assisted by React-Bootstrap to simplify site navigation
