Random Llama Image API. The world's first Llama as a Service (LaaS) - by @spencerlepine

This is a simple Node/Express REST API deployed to Heroku with GitHub Actions. It connects to the MongoDB NoSQL database, which stores image URL strings.

Check out the Image API source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/llama-as-a-service/images-service).

Originally, the goal of this project was to create a dockerized microservice architecture, with a gateway API and JWT authentintication. As you may suspect, this is an overly-complex solution for a simple REST API. I ran into a lot of issues working with Kubernetes, and have since left the project as is.

To keep development of each service organized, I used the polyrepo approach with everything organized under the [GitHub Organization](https://github.com/llama-as-a-service).

#### ‚úÖ Try It Out:
```sh
curl https://llama-as-a-service-images.herokuapp.com/random
```

##### JSON Response
```json
{
  "message": "https://images.theconversation.com/files/337593/original/file-20200526-106811-ql6d51.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1200&h=900.0&fit=crop"
}
```
